# C-DotNetKoans

This exercise walks you through major concepts in C# and dotnet while introducing you to basic testing by  having you complete small steps to make a test pass.  It was specifically designed for the curriculum at Nashville Software School, but cover all the basic constructs of the language.  

##What you need

Visual Studio - these Koans were made in Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition which you can find [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs?WT.srch=1&WT.mc_id=SEM_LNZ8Mnn5)  

##Getting Started

1. Fork and clone down the repo. 
2. Open the project in Visual Studio
3. Click on Build and select Build
4. When the project builds successfully click on Test -> Run -> All Tests
5. 150+ failed tests should appear in the Test Explorere window on the left
6. Look in the NSS_Koans_Tester project in Solution Explorer (View -> Solution Explorer if it is not already open) for a numbered list of test files.
7. Start with 1_Asserts.cs and modify the test to make it pass. Most test have comments supplied to provide hints. Some test will not have hints and you will have to set debug points and research to fix the failing test. 
8. The test files are numbered in a recommended order, but you can do them in any order.  

Have fun learning C#!
